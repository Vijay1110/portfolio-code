        Since beginning my journey as a freelance web developer nearly 3 years
        ago, I've done remote work for friends and for know peoples. I'm quietly
        confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my
        tech skill to next level.
        <br />
        <br /> During my college time, I took online courses like Advanced CSS
        and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More! The Complete Javascript
        Course, Javascript30, Understanding the Weird Parts, ES6, Modern React
        w/ Redux, React: The Complete Guide, Gatsby Bootcamp, Angular by mosh,
        Mean Stack by maximilian schwarzmüller ,read article series "Clean
        Code", and also watched countless youtube videos about Javascript.
        <br />
        <br />
        Because we know the best way to learn is to practice, I also did a bunch
        of personal projects with the knowledge I gathered from the courses, you
        can check them on my portfolio.
        <br />
        <br />I always want to learn more, do more, and be more. I’m also a firm
        believer that we should never settle. I’m hard working, super curious,
        passionate, committed, and also a fast learner!
